Description:
The Hangman Game is a classic word-guessing game implemented in Python. The aim of the project is to allow users to play the game where the computer selects a word at random, and the player attempts to guess the word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. The game provides an interactive interface for users to input their guesses and keeps track of the progress of the game, revealing correctly guessed letters and penalizing incorrect attempts. Throughout this project, I learned about classes , magic methods , methods in a class and While True loops.
